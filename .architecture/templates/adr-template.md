## Pragmatic Enforcer Analysis

**Reviewer**: [NAME]
**Mode**: [Strict | Balanced | Lenient]

**Note**: *This section only appears when pragmatic_mode is enabled in `.architecture/config.yml`*

**Overall Decision Complexity Assessment**:
[High-level assessment of whether this decision maintains appropriate simplicity or shows signs of over-engineering. Consider: Is this solving a current problem or a future possibility? Are we adding complexity for speculative needs?]

**Decision Challenge**:

**Proposed Decision**: "[Briefly quote the decision being made]"

**Necessity Assessment**: [Score 0-10]
- **Current need**: [Is this decision addressing a current, concrete requirement?]
- **Future need**: [What's the likelihood and timeframe for this being actually needed?]
- **Cost of waiting**: [What breaks if we defer this decision? What's the cost of implementing later?]
- **Evidence of need**: [What concrete evidence justifies this decision now?]

**Complexity Assessment**: [Score 0-10]
- **Added complexity**: [What complexity does this decision introduce to the system?]
- **Maintenance burden**: [What is the ongoing cost to maintain this?]
- **Learning curve**: [What is the impact on team/new developers?]
- **Dependencies introduced**: [What new dependencies or abstractions are added?]

**Alternative Analysis**:
[Review of whether simpler alternatives were adequately considered]
- Are the listed alternatives genuinely simpler, or just different?
- Is there a "do nothing" or "minimal change" option missing?
- Could we solve this with existing tools/patterns?

**Simpler Alternative Proposal**:
[If applicable, concrete proposal for a simpler approach that meets current actual requirements. This might be:
- A phased approach (implement minimal now, extend later)
- Using existing tools instead of custom solutions
- Deferring the decision until more information is available
- A less abstract/more direct solution]

**Recommendation**: [✅ Approve decision | ⚠️ Approve with simplifications | ⏸️ Defer until triggered | ❌ Recommend against]

**Justification**:
[Clear reasoning for the recommendation, balancing current needs vs future flexibility vs complexity costs]

**If Deferring or Simplifying**:
- **Trigger conditions**: [What would trigger implementing this decision or the full version?]
- **Minimal viable alternative**: [What's the simplest thing that could work right now?]
- **Migration path**: [If we implement the minimal version, how do we migrate later if needed?]

**Pragmatic Score**:
- **Necessity**: [X/10]
- **Complexity**: [X/10]
- **Ratio**: [Complexity/Necessity = X.X] *(Target: <1.5 for balanced mode)*

**Overall Assessment**:
[Summary judgment: Does this decision represent appropriate engineering for current needs, or potential over-engineering for future possibilities?]
