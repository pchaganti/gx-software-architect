## Senior Thinking Checklist

> **Note**: This checklist frames the architectural review by externalizing the "silent questions" that senior engineers ask before diving into technical details. Each reviewer should consider these questions from their specialist perspective.

Before diving into detailed strengths and weaknesses, reviewers should address these framing questions:

### Change Characterization
- **Nature of changes in this version**: Are we introducing new ideas, or expressing existing ones in new places?
- **Architectural depth**: Do changes belong at the surface (API, UX) or deep in the system?
- **Conceptual alignment**: How well do changes align with existing architectural patterns and domain model?

### Spread Analysis
- **Pattern propagation**: If the patterns/approaches in this version spread across the codebase, is that desirable or a liability?
- **Consistency impact**: Do these changes establish patterns we want repeated or should be contained?
- **Technical debt trajectory**: Are we creating consistency or divergence?

### Blast Radius Assessment
- **Failure scope**: What's the blast radius if these changes are wrong and need to be undone?
- **Component coupling**: Which components/services/modules are directly affected?
- **Team impact**: Which teams need to coordinate if changes fail or evolve?
- **User impact**: What's the user-facing risk if this goes wrong?

### Reversibility Analysis
- **Rollback feasibility**: How easily can these changes be reversed if needed?
- **Migration complexity**: What migration paths exist for reverting or evolving?
- **Option preservation**: Do these changes keep future options open or close doors?
- **Commitment level**: Are we making reversible decisions or permanent commitments?

### Timing & Sequencing
- **System readiness**: Is the system technically ready for these changes?
  - Do we have adequate observability?
  - Are dependencies stable?
  - Is infrastructure sufficient?
- **Team readiness**: Is the team prepared for these changes?
  - Do they understand the patterns being introduced?
  - Do they have necessary skills?
  - Is documentation adequate?
- **Sequencing concerns**: Are there prerequisites that should have come first?
- **Coordination needs**: What cross-team coordination is required?

### Social Cost Evaluation
- **Complexity burden**: Will these changes confuse more people than they help?
- **Learning curve**: What's the onboarding impact for new team members?
- **Cognitive load**: How much mental overhead do these patterns add?
- **Documentation needs**: What explanation is required for maintainability?

### Confidence Assessment
- **Model correctness**: Are we confident in the architectural model, not just the implementation?
- **Test coverage**: Could tests pass while the model is still wrong?
- **Assumption validation**: What assumptions underpin these changes? How validated are they?
- **Edge cases**: What edge cases might not be captured by current testing?

### Overall Architectural Direction
- **Alignment**: Do these changes move us toward or away from target architecture?
- **Evolution path**: Do they represent progress on our architectural evolution journey?
- **Technical debt**: Do they add to, reduce, or shift technical debt?

*Each specialist reviewer should consider these questions through their domain lens before providing detailed technical analysis.*
