# Architectural Principles

This document outlines the core architectural principles that guide all design decisions in the project. These principles should be referenced when making architectural decisions, evaluating designs, and conducting reviews.

## Core Principles

### 0. Livable Code

**Description**: Software should be designed for the people who need to live in it, not just for architectural purity or technical elegance.

**Rationale**: Developers spend most of their time working with existing code. A codebase should be comfortable to inhabit, maintain, and evolve over time.

**Wisdom**: 
> "Is your code the kind of cluttered house you might find on a reality TV show? Or the kind of sleek, minimalist house you might find in an architectural magazine? Neither one sounds like a place you could comfortably live."  
> — **Sarah Mei**

**Application**:
- Design for the day-to-day experience of developers working in the codebase
- Balance technical purity with practical needs
- Consider the cognitive load of navigating the system
- Focus on making the codebase welcoming to newcomers
- Debug communication patterns when code smells persist

### 1. Clarity over Cleverness

**Description**: Prefer simple, clear designs over clever, complex solutions, even when the latter might be more elegant or slightly more efficient.

**Rationale**: Clear designs are easier to understand, maintain, extend, and debug. They reduce cognitive load and make onboarding new developers faster.

**Wisdom**: 
> "I define architecture as a word we use when we want to talk about design but want to puff it up to make it sound important."  
> — **Martin Fowler**

**Application**:
- Favor straightforward implementations over complex abstractions
- Use established patterns over novel approaches when possible
- Document the "why" behind design decisions, not just the "how"
- If you have to explain how it works, it's probably too complex

### 2. Separation of Concerns

**Description**: Systems should be divided into distinct features with minimal overlap in functionality. Each component should have a clear responsibility.

**Rationale**: Well-separated components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, reducing cognitive load and simplifying changes.

**Wisdom**: 
> "The Single Responsibility Principle. A Module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."  
> — **Robert C. Martin**

**Application**:
- Define clear boundaries between subsystems
- Design components with single responsibilities
- Avoid shared state and hidden dependencies
- Use interfaces to decouple implementation details
- Focus on the domain model as the heart of your system

### 3. Evolvability

**Description**: The architecture should facilitate change and evolution over time without requiring complete rewrites.

**Rationale**: Requirements always change, and the ability to adapt is essential for long-term sustainability.

**Wisdom**: 
> "Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change."  
> — **Grady Booch**

> "The future is uncertain and you will never know less than you know right now."  
> — **Sandi Metz**

**Application**:
- Design for extensibility at key variation points
- Create stable interfaces between components
- Use abstraction layers to isolate changes
- Anticipate and plan for version transitions
- Create a model that gives the development team leverage against complexity
- Resist the urge to overdesign for imagined future needs

### 4. Observability

**Description**: The system should provide insights into its behavior, performance, and state.

**Rationale**: Effective monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization require visibility into system operation.

**Wisdom**: 
> "Truth can only be found in one place: the code."  
> — **Robert C. Martin**

**Application**:
- Build in logging, metrics, and tracing from the start
- Make error states and edge cases explicit and observable
- Design components to expose health and performance data
- Create clear audit trails for important operations
- Favor explicit over implicit behavior

### 5. Security by Design

**Description**: Security must be an integral part of the architecture, not an afterthought.

**Rationale**: Retrofitting security is more expensive, less effective, and often leaves vulnerabilities.

**Wisdom**: 
> "Code, without tests, is not clean. No matter how elegant it is, no matter how readable and accessible, if it hath not tests, it be unclean."  
> — **Robert C. Martin**

**Application**:
- Implement proper authentication and authorization at all levels
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Design for secure defaults
- Perform threat modeling during design phase
- Validate all inputs and sanitize all outputs

### 6. Domain-Centric Design

**Description**: The architecture should reflect and serve the problem domain, with a ubiquitous language that bridges technical and business concerns.

**Rationale**: When the model and implementation are closely aligned with the business domain, the system is more likely to meet user needs and adapt to changes in requirements.

**Wisdom**: 
> "A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge."  
> — **Eric Evans**

**Application**:
- Create a ubiquitous language shared by developers and domain experts
- Model the domain, not just the data
- Separate core domain from supporting subdomains
- Make implicit concepts explicit in the model
- Continuously refine the model as understanding deepens

### 7. Pragmatic Simplicity

**Description**: Favor practical, working solutions over theoretical perfection. Recognize that software architecture is an exercise in managing complexity, not eliminating it.

**Rationale**: Theoretical purity often adds complexity without proportional benefit. Real systems must balance many competing concerns.

**Wisdom**: 
> "Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time."  
> — **Linus Torvalds**

> "Instead of deciding on a class and then figuring out its responsibilities, you are now deciding on a message and figuring out where to send it. This transition from class-based design to message-based design is a turning point in your design career."  
> — **Sandi Metz**

**Application**:
- Value working software over comprehensive documentation
- Make incremental improvements rather than seeking perfection
- Question abstractions that don't demonstrably simplify the system
- Consider operational concerns alongside architectural purity
- Be willing to make pragmatic trade-offs when necessary
- Design from messages outward, not from classes inward
- When the future cost of doing nothing is the same as the current cost, postpone the decision

### 8. Change Impact Awareness

**Description**: Every architectural decision should explicitly consider its blast radius, reversibility, timing, and social cost before implementation.

**Rationale**: Senior engineers instinctively evaluate these factors, but this "silent checklist" rarely gets documented. Making change impact explicit enables better decisions and knowledge sharing.

**Wisdom**:
> "The act of explanation does something important. It slows you down enough to notice when your instincts are off. It also makes your reasoning visible in a way that solo work rarely does."
> — **Obie Fernandez**

**Application**:
- **Blast Radius**: Identify the scope of impact if a change fails or needs reversal. Which components, teams, and users are affected?
- **Reversibility**: Design changes to be reversible when possible. Ask "If we're wrong, how hard is it to undo?" Prefer approaches that keep options open.
- **Sequencing & Timing**: Consider whether the system and team are ready for a change. A technically correct change can still be wrong if introduced at the wrong time.
- **Social Cost**: Evaluate whether a solution will confuse more people than it helps. Consider the learning curve and cognitive load on the team.
- **False Confidence**: Question whether tests passing actually validates the model is correct. Look for places where implementation correctness doesn't guarantee solution correctness.
- **Change Characterization**: Clarify whether you're introducing a new idea or expressing an existing one in a new place. Understand if changes belong at the surface or deep in the system.
- **Spread Analysis**: If this pattern or approach spreads across the codebase, is that desirable or a liability?

**Examples**:

*Good - High Impact Awareness:*
```
Decision: Introduce new authentication pattern
Blast Radius: Affects 23 services, 4 teams, requires coordination
Reversibility: Medium - can rollback but requires migration scripts
Timing: System ready (observability in place), but Team B needs training
Social Cost: High learning curve, but improves long-term maintainability
Decision: Proceed with phased rollout, Team B training first
```

*Bad - Ignoring Impact:*
```
Decision: Introduce new authentication pattern
Implementation: Changed all services in one release
Result: Outage across all services, no rollback plan, team confused
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Documentation

All significant architectural decisions should be documented in Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that explain:
- The context and problem being addressed
- The decision that was made
- The consequences (positive and negative)
- Alternatives that were considered

### Review Process

Architectural changes should be reviewed against these principles. Reviews should explicitly address:
- How the change upholds or challenges each principle
- Trade-offs made between principles when they conflict
- Measures to mitigate any negative consequences

### Exceptions

Exceptions to these principles may be necessary in specific circumstances. When making exceptions:
- Document the exception and its justification
- Define the scope and boundaries of the exception
- Create a plan to eliminate or reduce the exception over time if possible
- Get approval from the architecture team

## Evolution of Principles

These principles should be reviewed and potentially revised:
- At the start of each major version development cycle
- When consistently encountering situations where the principles seem inadequate
- When new team members bring valuable alternative perspectives

Proposed changes to principles should be discussed by the entire architecture team and require consensus to adopt.

> "By reflecting on code that's been written, and 'code smells' that keep coming up, you can determine missing links in communication. You could continue to solve those code smells. You could refactor them all away - once per sprint even! However, that's only addressing the symptoms. The underlying problem is more likely to be one of communication."
