# Using AI Software Architect with Claude Skills

Quick guide for using AI Software Architect framework as Claude Skills in Claude Code.

## What are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude through organized prompts. The AI Software Architect skills provide seamless architectural guidance and documentation.

## Why Skills?

**vs MCP:**
- Simpler setup (no Node.js/npm)
- No dependencies
- Automatic invocation
- Portable and version-controllable

**vs CLAUDE.md:**
- Modular and focused
- Auto-discovered by Claude
- Reusable across projects
- Easier to maintain

## Installation

### Personal Skills (Recommended)

Use across all projects:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect /tmp/ai-architect-$$
cp -r /tmp/ai-architect-$$/.claude/skills ~/.claude/
# Temporary directory will be cleaned up automatically, or you can remove it:
# rm -rf /tmp/ai-architect-$$
```

### Project-Specific Skills

For one project only:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect /tmp/ai-architect-$$
cp -r /tmp/ai-architect-$$/.claude/skills/* .claude/skills/
# Temporary directory will be cleaned up automatically, or you can remove it:
# rm -rf /tmp/ai-architect-$$
```

### Quick Install Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install-skills.sh

TYPE="${1:-personal}"

if [ "$TYPE" = "personal" ]; then
    TARGET="$HOME/.claude/skills"
else
    TARGET=".claude/skills"
fi

mkdir -p "$TARGET"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/ai-architect-$$"
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect "$TEMP_DIR"
cp -r "$TEMP_DIR/.claude/skills/"* "$TARGET/"

echo "✅ Installed to $TARGET"
echo "Temporary files in $TEMP_DIR can be safely removed if you want."
echo "They will be automatically cleaned up on system restart."
```

```
Example: "Start architecture review for version 1.0"

**Specialist Review**:
```
Ask [Specialist Name] to review [target]

```

## How Skills Work

Claude automatically invokes skills based on your request:

- "Setup ai-software-architect" → setup-architect
- "Create ADR for..." → create-adr
- "Ask [specialist] to review..." → specialist-review
- "Start architecture review..." → architecture-review
- "List architecture members" → list-members
- "What's our architecture status?" → architecture-status

## Customization

### Modify Skills

```bash
# Edit any skill
vim ~/.claude/skills/setup-architect/SKILL.md

# Changes take effect immediately
```

### Create Custom Skills

```bash
mkdir ~/.claude/skills/my-custom-skill

cat > ~/.claude/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md <<'EOF'
---
name: my-custom-skill
description: Custom skill for my needs. Use when...
---

# My Custom Skill

## Process
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
EOF
```

### Combine with CLAUDE.md

Skills work alongside project instructions:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
[Your project details]

## Architecture

Uses AI Software Architect skills.

**Commands**:
- "Setup ai-software-architect" - Setup
- "Create ADR for [topic]" - Document
- "Ask [specialist] to review [target]" - Review
- "What's our architecture status?" - Status

[Rest of your instructions]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Found

```bash
# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# Should show:
# setup-architect/
# create-adr/
# architecture-review/
# specialist-review/
# list-members/
# architecture-status/
```

### Skills Not Invoked

Use exact trigger phrases:
- ✅ "Setup ai-software-architect"
- ❌ "Set up the architecture thing"

Or be explicit:
- "Use the setup-architect skill"

### Update Skills

```bash
# Backup current with timestamp
mkdir -p ~/.ai-architect-backups
mv ~/.claude/skills ~/.ai-architect-backups/skills-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Reinstall
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/ai-architect-$$"
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect "$TEMP_DIR"
cp -r "$TEMP_DIR/.claude/skills" ~/.claude/

echo "Backup created at ~/.ai-architect-backups/skills-TIMESTAMP/"
echo "You can safely remove this backup once you've verified the update works correctly."
echo "Temporary files in $TEMP_DIR will be automatically cleaned up on system restart."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with personal installation** - Use across all projects
2. **Customize per-project if needed** - Copy to `.claude/skills/`
3. **Version control project skills** - Commit if customized
4. **Document your workflow** - Add to README or CLAUDE.md
5. **Keep skills updated** - Periodically pull latest versions

## Examples

### New Project

```
You: Setup ai-software-architect

Claude: [Analyzes codebase: Next.js + TypeScript]
        [Adds JavaScript Expert, React Specialist, TypeScript Expert]
        [Creates initial analysis: 15 pages]
        [Identifies: Good structure, improve error handling, add tests]

You: Create ADR for error handling strategy

Claude: [Creates ADR-001-error-handling-strategy.md]
        [Documents try/catch vs error boundaries decision]
```

### Pre-Release Review

```
You: We're releasing v2.0. Full architecture review please.

Claude: [Reviews from 9 perspectives]
        [Finds: N+1 queries, rate limiting needed, docs gaps]
        [Creates 45-page review with priorities]
        [Suggests: Fix queries (critical), add rate limiting (high)]

You: Ask Performance Specialist to review the N+1 query issue

Claude: [Deep-dive on query performance]
        [Identifies 3 problem areas]
        [Provides specific fixes with code examples]
```

### Implementation with Methodology

```
# 1. Configure once in .architecture/config.yml
implementation:
  enabled: true
  methodology: "TDD"
  influences:
    - "Kent Beck - TDD by Example"
    - "Sandi Metz - POODR"

# 2. Document decision
You: Create ADR for authentication approach

Claude: [Creates ADR-002-authentication.md with JWT decision]

# 3. Implement with automatic methodology application
You: Implement authentication as the architects

Claude: [Writes tests first (TDD)]
        [Implements minimal code to pass]
        [Refactors using Sandi Metz principles]
        [Applies configured language practices]
        [Ensures definition of done]

# 4. Review implementation
You: Ask Security Specialist to review authentication

Claude: [Reviews from security perspective]
        [Validates JWT implementation]
        [Suggests additional hardening]
```

## Migration from MCP

Currently using MCP? Switch to skills:

```bash
# 1. Install skills
cp -r ai-software-architect/.claude/skills ~/.claude/

# 2. Remove MCP config (optional)
# Edit ~/.claude/config.json, remove ai-software-architect MCP entry

# 3. Test
# In Claude Code: "List architecture members"

# 4. Continue using existing docs
# All .architecture/ files remain compatible
```

## FAQ
