## Installation

Choose the installation method for your AI assistant:

### Claude Code Installation

Claude Code supports three installation methods:

**Option 1: Claude Skills (Recommended for Claude Code)**

Install as reusable skills that work across all your projects:

```bash
# Clone and install skills
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect /tmp/ai-architect-$$
cp -r /tmp/ai-architect-$$/.claude/skills ~/.claude/
# Temporary directory will be cleaned up automatically, or you can remove it:
# rm -rf /tmp/ai-architect-$$
```

Then in any project:
```
Setup ai-software-architect
```

See [USAGE-WITH-CLAUDE-SKILLS.md](USAGE-WITH-CLAUDE-SKILLS.md) for detailed instructions.

**Benefits**: Simpler setup, no dependencies, automatic skill invocation, portable

**Option 2: MCP Server**

```bash
npm install -g ai-software-architect
```

Then configure in `~/.claude/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-software-architect": {
      "command": "mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**: Programmatic automation, external tool integration

**Option 3: Traditional Setup**

```
Setup architecture using: https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect
```

See [USAGE-WITH-CLAUDE.md](USAGE-WITH-CLAUDE.md) for detailed instructions.

**Benefits**: No installation required, works immediately

### Cursor Installation  

If you're using Cursor, you have two options:

**Option 1: MCP Server (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g ai-software-architect
```
Then configure in Cursor settings (`settings.json`):
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "ai-software-architect": {
      "command": "mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Traditional Setup**
```
Setup architecture using @https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect
```
See [USAGE-WITH-CURSOR.md](USAGE-WITH-CURSOR.md) for detailed traditional setup instructions.

### GitHub Copilot / Codex Installation

**MCP Support**: GitHub Copilot and Codex currently have limited MCP support. Use the traditional setup method:

```
Setup architecture using: https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect
```

See [USAGE-WITH-CODEX.md](USAGE-WITH-CODEX.md) for detailed setup instructions. The framework will be configured with context files that GitHub Copilot and Codex can automatically understand.

## Upgrading

Already have AI Software Architect installed? Update to get the latest features and improvements.

### Quick Update (Recommended)

For any AI assistant, simply ask:

```
Update the software architect framework from https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect
```

Your AI assistant will fetch the latest framework files from the main branch while preserving your project's architecture artifacts (ADRs, reviews, recalibration plans).

### Manual Update Methods

**If using Claude Skills:**
```bash
# Update skills to latest version - backup old versions first
mkdir -p ~/.ai-architect-backups/skills-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
cd ~/.claude/skills
mv setup-architect architecture-review create-adr list-members architecture-status specialist-review ~/.ai-architect-backups/skills-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Install from latest
git clone https://github.com/codenamev/ai-software-architect /tmp/ai-architect-$$
cp -r /tmp/ai-architect-$$/.claude/skills/* ./

echo "Backup created at ~/.ai-architect-backups/skills-TIMESTAMP/"
echo "You can safely remove this backup once you've verified the update works correctly."
echo "Temporary files will be automatically cleaned up on system restart."
```

**If using MCP Server:**
```bash
# Update to latest version
npm update -g ai-software-architect

# Or reinstall
npm install -g ai-software-architect
```

**If using Traditional Setup:**
```bash
# From your project root
cd .architecture
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
cd ..
```

**Note**: Updates preserve your project's custom architecture artifacts (ADRs, reviews, member customizations) while updating framework files (templates, base configuration, scripts).

### What Gets Updated

**✅ Updated Files:**
- `.architecture/templates/` - Templates for ADRs, reviews, AGENTS.md
- `.architecture/principles.md` - Core architectural principles (if not customized)
- Framework scripts and helper files
- MCP server (if using MCP installation)
- Claude Skills (if using Skills installation)

**✅ Preserved Files:**
- `.architecture/decisions/adrs/` - Your architectural decision records
- `.architecture/reviews/` - Your architecture review documents
- `.architecture/recalibration/` - Your recalibration plans
- `.architecture/members.yml` - Your customized team members
- `.architecture/config.yml` - Your configuration settings
- All your project-specific customizations

See [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) for detailed upgrade instructions and troubleshooting.

### Other AI Assistants

Support for additional AI assistants can be added by creating appropriate configuration files in the `.coding-assistants` directory following the established patterns.

## Key Features

### Architectural Wisdom

The framework incorporates wisdom from influential software architects including Martin Fowler, Sandi Metz, Robert C. Martin, Eric Evans, Sarah Mei, Obie Fernandez, and others. These principles are embedded in the architectural documentation.

**Externalizing Senior Thinking**: The framework systematically captures "senior engineering thinking"—the invisible architectural reasoning about blast radius, reversibility, timing, and social cost that typically stays undocumented. By forcing explicit documentation of these considerations, we're creating the corpus of senior architectural thinking that the industry lacks.

### Multi-Perspective Reviews

Architecture reviews consider multiple specialized perspectives:
- Systems Architecture
- Domain Expertise
- Security
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Implementation Strategy (HOW and WHEN)
- AI Engineering
- And dynamically created specialists as needed

### Pragmatic Mode (YAGNI Enforcement)

Pragmatic Mode helps prevent over-engineering by adding a "Pragmatic Enforcer" who:
- **Challenges complexity** - Questions abstractions, patterns, and "best practices" that may not be needed yet
- **Proposes simpler alternatives** - Suggests minimal implementations that meet current requirements
- **Calculates trade-offs** - Scores necessity vs. complexity (target ratio <1.5)
- **Tracks deferrals** - Documents decisions to defer features with clear trigger conditions

**When to use**:
- New projects or MVPs
- Teams prone to over-engineering
- Resource-constrained environments
- Projects with tight deadlines

**Configurable intensity**:
- **Strict**: Challenges aggressively, requires strong justification
- **Balanced**: Thoughtful challenges, accepts justified complexity (recommended)
- **Lenient**: Raises concerns without blocking

**Exemptions for Critical Areas**:
Pragmatic Mode maintains rigorous standards for:
- **Security-critical features**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation
- **Data integrity**: Database transactions, data validation, backup strategies
- **Compliance requirements**: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, audit logging
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader support

Enable with:
```
Enable pragmatic mode
```

See [ADR-002](/.architecture/decisions/adrs/ADR-002-pragmatic-guard-mode.md) and [Pragmatic Mode Summary](/.architecture/decisions/PRAGMATIC-MODE-SUMMARY.md) for details.

**Using with Implementation Guidance**: When using both Pragmatic Mode and Implementation Guidance together, pragmatic mode respects your configured security practices and methodological choices while challenging unnecessary complexity in other areas. The pragmatic enforcer ensures implementations remain simple while still following your team's documented standards for security, testing, and code quality.

### Implementation Guidance

Configuration-driven implementation that applies your team's methodology and best practices automatically:

**Configure once**:
```yaml
implementation:
  enabled: true
  methodology: "TDD"
  influences:
    - "Kent Beck - TDD by Example"
    - "Sandi Metz - POODR"
    - "Martin Fowler - Refactoring"
```

**Then simply say**:
```
Implement authentication as the architects
```

**Benefits**:
- **90% prompt reduction**¹: 4 words instead of 40+
- **Consistent quality**: Methodology applied systematically
- **Team standards**: Documented practices in version control
- **Cross-session persistence**: Configuration always applied

**Supports**:
- Multiple methodologies (TDD, BDD, DDD, Test-Last, Exploratory)
- Coding influences (Kent Beck, Sandi Metz, Martin Fowler, Gary Bernhardt, etc.)
- Language-specific practices and style guides
- Security practices (always applied, exempt from YAGNI)
- Quality standards and refactoring guidelines

Use with:
```
Implement [feature] as the architects
```
