# AI Software Architect Framework - Usage

## Core Commands

### Create Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

**Command**: "Create ADR for [decision topic]"

**Examples**:
- "Create ADR for using PostgreSQL database"
- "Document architectural decision for microservices"
- "Write ADR about authentication approach"

**Result**: Creates numbered ADR in `.architecture/decisions/adrs/`

### Start Architecture Review

**Command**: "Start architecture review for [version/feature]"

**Examples**:
- "Start architecture review for version 2.0.0"
- "Review architecture for authentication system"
- "Conduct architecture review for payment feature"

**Result**: Comprehensive multi-perspective review document

### Request Specialist Review

**Command**: "Ask [Specialist Name] to review [target]"

**Examples**:
- "Ask Security Specialist to review API authentication"
- "Have Performance Expert review database queries"
- "Get Domain Expert's opinion on data model"

**Result**: Focused review from specialist perspective

**Note**: If specialist doesn't exist, they'll be created automatically

### List Architecture Team

**Command**: "List architecture members"

**Alternatives**:
- "Who's on the architecture team?"
- "Show me the architects"
- "What specialists are available?"

**Result**: List of team members with specialties

### Check Architecture Status

**Command**: "What's our architecture status?"

**Alternatives**:
- "Show architecture documentation"
- "Architecture health check"
- "How many ADRs do we have?"

**Result**: Summary of ADRs, reviews, team members, and health

### Start Recalibration

**Command**: "Start architecture recalibration for [target]"

**Examples**:
- "Start recalibration for version 2.0 review"
- "Create action plan from authentication review"
- "Plan implementation of security recommendations"

**Result**: Prioritized action plan with ADR updates and roadmap

## Workflow Patterns

### New Feature Development
1. "Start architecture review for [feature]"
2. "Ask [relevant specialist] to review [specific concern]"
3. "Create ADR for [key decisions]"
4. "Start recalibration for [feature]"

### Technical Debt Assessment
1. "Review [component] for technical debt"
2. "Ask Maintainability Expert to suggest priorities"
3. "Create ADR for refactoring approach"
4. "Start recalibration for improvements"

### Pre-Release Review
1. "What's our architecture status?"
2. "Start architecture review for version X.Y.Z"
3. "Address findings from review"
4. "Start recalibration for next version"

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include context and scope in requests
2. **Use Specialists**: Leverage different perspectives
3. **Document Decisions**: Create ADRs for significant choices
4. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule reviews before major releases
5. **Track Progress**: Use status checks regularly
6. **Link Documents**: Reference ADRs in code and reviews

## Tips for Cursor Integration

- **Reference files**: Mention specific files when relevant
- **Ask follow-ups**: Dive deeper into recommendations
- **Request examples**: Get concrete code examples
- **Validate against principles**: Check alignment with ADRs
- **Iterative refinement**: Start broad, then focus

## Common Questions
