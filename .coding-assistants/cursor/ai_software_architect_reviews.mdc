# AI Software Architect Framework - Reviews

## Review Types

### Full Architecture Reviews
Comprehensive evaluation from all team perspectives.

**When to Use**:
- Before major version releases
- Quarterly architecture assessments
- After significant system changes
- When cross-cutting concerns emerge

**Command**: "Start architecture review for [version/feature]"

**Process**:
1. Individual member reviews from each perspective
2. Collaborative discussion to synthesize findings
3. Consolidated recommendations with priorities
4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Output**: Comprehensive review document in `.architecture/reviews/`

### Specialist Reviews
Focused evaluation from single expert perspective.

**When to Use**:
- Specific concern in one domain (security, performance, etc.)
- Deep-dive after full review
- Targeted code/component analysis
- Quick expert opinion needed

**Command**: "Ask [Specialist Name] to review [target]"

**Process**:
1. Load or create specialist
2. Analyze from specialist's perspective only
3. Provide focused recommendations
4. Assess risks in specialty area

**Output**: Specialist review document in `.architecture/reviews/`

## Architecture Team Members

### Core Members (Always Present)

**Systems Architect**
- Focus: Overall system coherence, integration patterns
- Specialties: Distributed systems, scalability, service architecture
- Use when: Evaluating system-wide changes

**Security Specialist**
- Focus: Threat modeling, security patterns, data protection
- Specialties: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- Use when: Security implications exist

**Performance Specialist**
- Focus: Optimization, scalability, resource management
- Specialties: Caching, database optimization, profiling
- Use when: Performance concerns arise

**Maintainability Expert**
- Focus: Code quality, technical debt, refactoring
- Specialties: Clean code, design patterns, testing
- Use when: Long-term maintenance is consideration

### Technology-Specific Members (Added During Setup)

**JavaScript/TypeScript Expert**
- Added for: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js projects
- Focus: Modern JS patterns, async programming, tooling

**Framework Specialists**
- Added for: React, Vue, Angular, Rails, Django, etc.
- Focus: Framework-specific patterns and best practices

**Domain Experts**
- Added as needed: Ruby Expert, Go Expert, etc.
- Focus: Language-specific idioms and ecosystem

### Dynamic Member Creation

Request any specialist - they'll be created automatically:
- "Ask Accessibility Expert to review forms"
- "Have API Design Specialist review endpoints"
- "Get Database Architect's opinion on schema"

Created members are added to `.architecture/members.yml` permanently.

## Review Process Details

### Phase 1: Individual Reviews

Each team member independently reviews from their perspective:
- Analyzes relevant aspects
- Identifies strengths
- Notes concerns and risks
- Provides recommendations

**Duration**: Focused on specialist domain

### Phase 2: Collaborative Discussion

Team members discuss findings:
- Identify common themes
- Resolve conflicting perspectives
- Prioritize concerns
- Build consensus on recommendations

**Duration**: Synthesis of individual findings

### Phase 3: Consolidated Report

Final document includes:
- Executive summary
- Individual perspectives
- Collaborative findings
- Prioritized recommendations:
  - Immediate (0-2 weeks)
  - Short-term (2-8 weeks)
  - Long-term (2-6 months)
- Risk assessment
- Success metrics

## Pragmatic Mode (YAGNI Enforcement)

When enabled in `.architecture/config.yml`:

**Pragmatic Enforcer** participates in reviews:
- Challenges unnecessary complexity
- Questions premature optimization
- Proposes simpler alternatives
- Calculates pragmatic scores

**Modes**:
- **Strict**: Aggressive challenge, require strong justification
- **Balanced**: Thoughtful challenge, accept justified complexity
- **Lenient**: Raise concerns without blocking

**Exemptions** (full rigor applied):
- Security-critical features
- Data integrity requirements
- Compliance mandates
- Accessibility requirements

## Review Findings Categories

### Strengths
What's working well and should be maintained/amplified.

### Areas for Improvement
Current state → Desired state, with priority.

### Technical Debt
Accumulated shortcuts and their impact:
- **High Priority**: Impacting development velocity
- **Medium Priority**: Manageable but growing
- **Low Priority**: Minor annoyances

### Risks
**Technical Risks**: Architecture-related
**Operational Risks**: Deployment/maintenance
**Business Risks**: Impact on objectives

Each with: Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation strategy

## Post-Review Actions

### 1. Review Findings
Read complete review document.

### 2. Prioritize Recommendations
Determine which to act on immediately vs. defer.

### 3. Start Recalibration
"Start architecture recalibration for [target]"

Creates action plan:
- ADR updates needed
- Refactoring tasks
- Implementation roadmap
- Progress tracking

### 4. Create/Update ADRs
Document decisions made based on review.

### 5. Track Progress
Monitor implementation of recommendations.

### 6. Schedule Follow-up
Plan next review based on findings.

## Best Practices

**Frequency**:
- Major versions: Always review before release
- Regular: Quarterly or bi-annually
- Triggered: When concerns arise or major changes occur

**Preparation**:
- Update principles document
- Ensure recent ADRs documented
- Gather relevant metrics
- Identify specific concerns to address

**Participation**:
- Include all relevant specialists
- Request additional specialists as needed
- Encourage diverse perspectives
- Document dissenting opinions

**Documentation**:
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Link to related ADRs
- Date all recommendations

**Follow-through**:
- Don't let reviews gather dust
- Create recalibration plans
- Track implementation progress
- Measure success against metrics

## Review Outputs

All reviews create:
1. **Review Document**: Complete analysis and recommendations
2. **Action Items**: Extracted from recommendations
3. **ADR Candidates**: Decisions needing documentation
4. **Recalibration Plan**: When started

## Integration with Development

**Code Reviews**:
- Reference architecture reviews in PRs
- Check alignment with recommendations
- Document architectural changes

**Planning**:
- Use review findings in sprint planning
- Allocate time for architectural work
- Balance features with tech debt

**Retrospectives**:
- Include architectural discussions
- Review progress on recommendations
- Adjust approach based on learnings
