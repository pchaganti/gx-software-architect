# AI Software Architect Framework - Setup

## Setup Command

To set up the framework in this project, use:
```
Setup ai-software-architect
```

Alternative phrases:
- "Setup architecture"
- "Initialize architecture framework"

## What Setup Does

1. **Analyzes Project**: Det

ects languages, frameworks, and patterns
2. **Creates Directory Structure**: Sets up `.architecture/` with proper subdirectories
3. **Customizes Members**: Creates architecture team based on detected technologies
4. **Customizes Principles**: Tailors principles to your technology stack
5. **Sets up Templates**: Provides ready-to-use templates for ADRs and reviews
6. **Conducts Initial Analysis**: Creates comprehensive initial system analysis

## Setup Verification

After setup, verify with:
```
What's our architecture status?
```

You should see:
- Framework setup: Complete
- ADRs created: 0 (initial state)
- Reviews conducted: 1 (initial analysis)
- Team members: 4-8 (depending on stack)

## Post-Setup Steps

1. **Review Initial Analysis**: Check `.architecture/reviews/initial-system-analysis.md`
2. **Customize Members**: Edit `.architecture/members.yml` if needed
3. **Review Principles**: Check `.architecture/decisions/principles.md`
4. **Create First ADR**: Document an existing architectural decision

## When to Run Setup

- **First time**: When adding framework to project
- **Do NOT re-run**: If `.architecture/` already exists
- **Check first**: Use status command before setup

## Customization After Setup

You can customize:
- Members (`.architecture/members.yml`)
- Principles (`.architecture/decisions/principles.md`)
- Templates (`.architecture/templates/`)
- Configuration (`.architecture/config.yml`)

## Troubleshooting

**Already set up error**: Framework is already installed, use status command instead
**Permission errors**: Check directory permissions
**Missing dependencies**: Ensure git is available if cloning

## Next Steps

After setup:
1. "List architecture members" - See your team
2. "Create ADR for [first decision]" - Document a decision
3. "Start architecture review" - Conduct first review
