# AI Software Architect Framework - Overview

This project uses the AI Software Architect framework for structured architecture management. The framework provides a systematic approach to documenting decisions, conducting reviews, and managing architectural evolution.

## Framework Purpose

The AI Software Architect framework helps development teams:
- Document architectural decisions systematically (ADRs)
- Conduct multi-perspective architecture reviews
- Track architectural evolution over time
- Maintain alignment between decisions and implementation
- Foster collaboration between stakeholders

## Core Concepts

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions, including context, alternatives considered, and rationale for the chosen approach.

### Architecture Team Members
Defined personas representing different architectural perspectives (security, performance, maintainability, domain expertise, etc.). Reviews leverage these personas for comprehensive analysis.

### Review Process
Structured evaluation of architecture from multiple specialized perspectives, resulting in prioritized findings and actionable recommendations.

### Recalibration
Translation of review findings into concrete action plans, including ADR updates, refactoring tasks, and implementation roadmaps.

## Integration with Cursor

This framework is designed to work seamlessly with Cursor's AI assistance. Use natural language commands to:
- Request architecture reviews
- Create ADRs
- Get specialist perspectives
- Analyze code against principles

The framework's structure and documentation provide Cursor with the context needed to give architecturally sound recommendations.

## Getting Started

If the framework hasn't been set up yet, use:
```
Setup ai-software-architect
```

To check current status:
```
What's our architecture status?
```

For more information, see the other framework rule files in this directory.
